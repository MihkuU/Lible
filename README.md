# Lible
Lible is a toolbox containing multiple programming libraries for implementing quantum chemical methods. The focus is on providing a clear and modern C++ programming interface for the user while being as efficient as possible in the utilities backend. The name LIBLE corresponds to Library for Linear Efficiency. It doesn't mean everything provided here is asymptotically linear scaling, the name just sounded good.
