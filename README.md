# Lible
Lible is a toolbox containing multiple libraries for implementing quantum chemical methods. The focus is on providing a clear and modern C++ programming interface while being as efficient as possible in the backend. The name LIBLE corresponds to Library for Linear Efficiency. It doesn't mean everything here is asymptotically linear scaling, the name just sounded good.
