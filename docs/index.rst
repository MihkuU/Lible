`Lible <https://github.com/MihkuU/Lible/>`_ is a modern C++ library that aims to provide the basic
utilities used in quantum chemical method development. The library provides the utilities in a form 
of custom types and thin-grained functions and aims to cover various concepts in quantum chemistry:

* :ref:`Calculation-of-molecular-integrals`
* Geometry optimization
* Spin adaptation
* Linear algebra solvers
* Formula derivation
* etc.

Therefore, Lible is designed in a modular manner, where each of these topics comes with a
a separate programming interface, or *namespace*, to be specific.
